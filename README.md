# Design-an-Arithmetic-Unit
The aim of this project is to  design an Arithmetic Unit, and write a  code for functional verification. Using design Ripple Adder, Look-ahead Adder . Arithmetic Unit in VHDL language and  simulation tools .The Arithmetic  Unit and Ripple Adder, Look-ahead Adder is to be built structurally from a library of gates basic gate with different delays .A CPU consists of three main sections: memory for variables (registers), control circuitry (microcode), and the ALU. The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is the part of a CPU that actually does calculations and condition testing in this project we want only Arithmetic unit without logic .For example, if you wish to add two binary numbers, it is the AU that is responsible for producing the result.
